  I created a tiny read called 'Paper Factory' - it is one story told in just
  fourteen poems.  Brevity can truly be a source of genius.

'Blackout poetry' (Google it! > you'll thank me) is a favourite warm-up of mine because it forces each word to earn its spot on the page. It proves some of the best material can come from the distillation of ideas down into very few words. 

Cutting down on description also honours the reader's role in shaping the story using their own perceptions and experiences ... there's room for everyone to see something different. 

Which is why I loved the challenge of QWC's #8WordStory.

I'm still chuffed my story was screened on billboards in and around Brisbane.
