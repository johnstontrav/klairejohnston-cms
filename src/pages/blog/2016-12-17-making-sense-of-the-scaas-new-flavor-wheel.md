  Words are powerful.  And yet, we carry around these little weapons without

Some people have athletic ability. Others are good with their hands. Some may be natural leaders, have a voice like an angel, or love how maths makes them tick.

My gift has always been words. 

Words ARE powerful. I've seen evidence of this in the stirring speeches of world leaders, the impassioned revelations of entrepreneurs, in clever TED Talks and through the artful lyrics of great songwriters.

The best comedians can move us to laughter, then to tears, then into a gut-wrenching, breathless and welcome combination of both. Sometimes with just one word.

Think about it. 'Yes' can mean so many things. Can change everything. 

And in the next beat, so can 'No'. 



## The words that changed it all

I've MC'd weddings, addressed government forums, conducted workshops and delivered guest speaker presentations. 

Yet it was a collection of only about a dozen lines that finally brought home the responsibility I have to write hard and share big.  

At the funeral of my grandmother only last month, I wrote words from the heart and spoke them at the small ceremony.  When family thanked me for their illumination of her great life and how these helped lift some of the sorrow, I felt a glow, knowing Grandma would also approve. 

The evening before, I helped my uncle frame up his eulogy, which was peppered with great ideas, though - according to him - just didn't thread together with the message he was trying to impart. It was important, I knew. 

I thought it was about tribute. About legacy. Though what I saw in his face at the service, and the relief once the words were delivered, made me realise I was wrong. It was actually about healing. 

Having crafted his words into the shape of the love he wanted to reflect, I gifted him something.

My words shifted his world. Those few lines held so much power. 



## It's the hardest thing...

"It is the hardest thing - a long goodbye. And yet, what a life to celebrate. Grandma is weaved into our DNA, our consciousness, our memories, our subconsciouses. She still threads this family together, as Grandad did, and hanging on to that is the biggest honour we can bestow."

These were the few words to my mother she borrowed for her speech on the day.  These were part of her healing, too.

I the emotional exhaustion of the aftermath fo the funeral, I busied myself with decluttering some corners of my home. In what seemed like an affirmation, I unearthed the eulogy I delivered for my father-in-law and for the first time in so long recall how many had come to me and thanked me for the way those words touched them. 

In the same box was a copy of anthology _Mending Matters,_ published as a tribute to 100 years of women's suffrage in Australia and which includes one of my poems.

Going through the papers I also found the words I had written for a friend, to hold on her behalf, should her cancer journey not turn out as desired. 

I re-read ....





## The XXXX

It's ironic really that it's taken the words of others - pointed, timely and surprising - to bring home to me the importance of sharing what I write. \

It would be polite to say I've felt compelled by a few wonderful and worldly people to share more of my work.  It would be more truthful to say that they're making a mission of not letting me escape my responsibility of using this 'word thing' of mine to make a difference. They certainly won't take 'No' for an answer.

Coffee cupping, or coffee tasting, is the practice of observing the tastes and aromas of brewed coffee. It is a professional practice but can be done informally by anyone or by professionals known as "Q Graders". A standard coffee cupping procedure involves deeply sniffing the coffee, then loudly slurping the coffee so it spreads to the back of the tongue.

The coffee taster attempts to measure aspects of the coffee's taste, specifically the body (the texture or mouthfeel, such as oiliness), sweetness, acidity (a sharp and tangy feeling, like when biting into an orange), flavour (the characters in the cup), and aftertaste. Since coffee beans embody telltale flavours from the region where they were grown, cuppers may attempt to identify the coffee's origin.
