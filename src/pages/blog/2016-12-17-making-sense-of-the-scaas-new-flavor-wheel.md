Some people have athletic ability. Others are good with their hands. Some may be natural leaders, have a voice like an angel, or love how maths makes them tick.

My gift has always been words. 

Words ARE powerful. I've seen evidence of this in the stirring speeches of world leaders, the impassioned revelations of entrepreneurs, in clever TED Talks and through the artful lyrics of great songwriters.

The best comedians can move us to laughter, then to tears, then into a gut-wrenching, breathless and welcome combination of both. Sometimes with just one word.

Think about it. 'Yes' can mean so many things. Can change everything.

Coffee cupping, or coffee tasting, is the practice of observing the tastes and aromas of brewed coffee. It is a professional practice but can be done informally by anyone or by professionals known as "Q Graders". A standard coffee cupping procedure involves deeply sniffing the coffee, then loudly slurping the coffee so it spreads to the back of the tongue.

The coffee taster attempts to measure aspects of the coffee's taste, specifically the body (the texture or mouthfeel, such as oiliness), sweetness, acidity (a sharp and tangy feeling, like when biting into an orange), flavour (the characters in the cup), and aftertaste. Since coffee beans embody telltale flavours from the region where they were grown, cuppers may attempt to identify the coffee's origin.
